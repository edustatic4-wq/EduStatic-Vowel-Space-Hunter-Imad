# Project Guidelines: 2D Phaser Platformer

This project is a 2D platformer game built with the Phaser framework. Our goal is to create a professional, beautiful, and production-ready web game.

## Key Principles:

- **Buildless Environment:** We leverage modern ESM modules and importmaps for a zero-build-configuration setup.
- **Incremental Development:** Changes are made in small, logical steps. Each step focuses on a single, complete feature.
- **Code Quality:** We write clean, well-structured, and maintainable code.
- **Visual Polish:** The game should have a professional and appealing visual style.
- **Iterations size:** Make sure that every time you edit the game - we have visible effect.

Let's build an amazing game together!
